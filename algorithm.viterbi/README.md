# Viterbi Algorithm
The Viterbi Algorithm is a fast, exact algorithm for solving for all unknown variables of a [Hidden Markov Model](https://github.com/hpcanalytics/Hidden-Markov-Model) simultaneously -- in other words, for performing MAP (Maximum A Posteriori) inference.
# Exemplar application
[Project:Layer finding in polar ice sheets](http://vision.soic.indiana.edu/papers/icesheets2012icpr.pdf) is one case of using Viterbi algorithm to solve a real problem.
